This is a python script to slow down music by 20% (can be changed in the code)

make sure you have python installed and unzip the folder before using

if there is any issue you may have to 'pip install pydub'


To use:

	1. place your file WITH ENDING '.mp3' in /music (make sure that there is ONLY 1 file in music folder)

	2. run the code with any IDE or cmd(in the folder press F4 and type in 'cmd' then type 'py main.py' and it will run the code)

	3. one its done it will print 'Finished: your-file.mp3' in the console

	4. get your file in finished folder with the same name and (slowed at end)
